# Web Windows Smart Quotes Replacer

This is a simple python program that goes through all files inside the old_files directory and replaces windows smart quotes found in .htm, .html, .asp, and .aspx files. It writes them to new files located in the new_files directory.

## Requirements

1. Python 3

*python can be installed from this [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/).*

## Usage

1. Create two folders in this project directory named `old_files` and `new_files`.

2. Place all files needing to be converted into the `old_files` directory.

3. In terminal (on Mac) or command prompt (on Windows) go into the project directory and run the following command `python3 convert.py`.

All converted files will be in the `new_files` directory once the script has finished running.
